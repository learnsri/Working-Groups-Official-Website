        <p class="hero-lead">
          The LEARN Working Groups Platform strengthens collaboration, coordination, and national capacity-building across
          Sri Lanka’s higher education and research ecosystem. Led by the Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN),
          it brings together universities, researchers, policymakers, and international partners to address priority
          challenges through focused, outcome-driven collaboration.

        <h2>Platform Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This initiative reflects LEARN’s evolution from a national research and education network into a facilitator of
          innovation, dialogue, and long-term institutional partnerships. The Working Groups provide a structured mechanism
          for transforming shared challenges into coordinated research agendas, pilot projects, and policy-relevant outcomes.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h3>Origins at LEARN36</h3>
        <p>
          The Working Groups were formally launched at LEARN36, the 36th Annual General Meeting of LEARN, which brought
          together academic leaders, government representatives, researchers, and international partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussions emphasized the need for coordinated responses to digital transformation, artificial intelligence adoption,
          and sustainability challenges within Sri Lanka’s education and research sectors.

        <h3>Alignment with Regional and Global Networks</h3>
        <p>
          The LEARN Working Groups are closely aligned with the Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN) framework. This alignment
          enables Sri Lankan institutions to engage in regional research collaboration, open data initiatives, and shared
          capacity-building efforts across the Asia–Pacific region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through APAN-linked activities, the Working Groups connect local research to regional expertise in areas such as
          digital agriculture, AI ethics, open science, and disaster resilience—ensuring that national initiatives remain
          globally informed and interoperable.
